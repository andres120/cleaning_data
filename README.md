## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to apply all the skills learned in this course by collecting raw data and turning it into a clean data set.

The script that processes the data is `run_analysis.R`, it includes some comments of the process, but a detailed description of the process can be found in the file `CodeBook.Rmd`. It writes `tidy_data_set.txt` which contains the clean data.
